    <div class="myStory">
      <p>
        Growing up in Philadelphia, police brutality, gang violence and drug abuse was a daily occurrence in my neighborhood. I was raised by my mother and I am one of 5 children, 4 brothers and myself. I moved with my eldest son to the Pacific Northwest in the late 90's and began a career in mental health and addiction in my late 20's. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I moved to Oregon, I was fortunate to be a part of a mental health agency that allowed me to work all over Oregon.
        My experience and history in the field includes, individual and group counseling, probation counseling, facilitating diversion
        classes, taking part in research studies measuring statistics, deaths and overall concerns directly related to driving while under the influence. I have worked with DHS, underprivileged youth, foster care and teaching and counseling those in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have now semi-retired, however, with everything that is currently happening in our community, it is clear that we all need support and encouragement. Just over the past 3 months there has been a significant increase in domestic violence, suicide numbers continue to soar, Covid 19 has threatened both our safety and the safety of our loved ones, racism is prevalent, and all of us are struggling to keep out heads held high. I would like to provide counseling and support to anyone who wants it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, many do not have access to counseling services for financial reasons, stigmas surrounding shame, lack of transportation, or understandably they just arent sure where to start. Well, I want to be the solution. I would like to offer tele-health counseling to anyone who needs it, no questions asked. We can facetime, zoom or simply talk on the phone. I do not need to know your name, or any information you are unwilling to give me. We can do daily, weekly or monthly calls as your schedule permits. The structure is completely up to you, it is whatever will help you most.
